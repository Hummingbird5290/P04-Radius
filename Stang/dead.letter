Subject: The Squid Cache (version 3.1.20) died.

You've encountered a fatal error in the Squid Cache version 3.1.20.
If a core file was created (possibly in the swap directory),
please execute 'gdb squid core' or 'dbx squid core', then type 'where',
and report the trace back to squid-bugs@squid-cache.org.

Thanks!
